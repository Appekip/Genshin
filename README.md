Gacha mechanic (loot box) simulated with a gui. Program simulates the current banner available in Genshin's version 3.1. (Cyno's rate up banner)

Simulator point was to prove/disprove the hidden "soft pity" mechanic that isn't advertized anywhere.

The simulator is based on the information available in the game (drop rates, pity mechanics, etc). 
This means that it doesn't involve the hidden "soft pity" mechanic that's in the game so the rates are and stay ruthless. 
The advertised drop rates are, 5 stars, 0.6%, 4 stars, 5.1% and the rest are 3 stars. 

The gacha mechanic is supposed to work in a way that every 10th pull is guaranteed to be a 4 star (if the prior 9 were 3 stars) and 90th pull is guaranteed to be a five star (if the prior 89 were 4 or 3 stars).

The soft pity is theorized to work in a way that it drastically raises the 5 star drop rate after the 75th drop. Usually players get a five star at around 75 - 80 pulls.
This doesn't really replicate in my simulator since most 5 stars go to the 90 pull pity. This indicates that the hidden "soft pity" exists.
