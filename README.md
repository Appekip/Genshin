# Genshin
Gacha mechanic simulated with a gui. Program simulates the current banner available in Genshin's version 3.1. 

The simulator is based on the information available in the game (drop rates, pity mechanics, etc). 
This means that it doesn't involve the hidden "soft pity" mechanic that's in the game so the rates are and stay ruthless.
